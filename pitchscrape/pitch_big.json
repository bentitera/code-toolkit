Despite his best intentions to reflect a necessary sea change in the way we treat our terrestrial home, the resulting ten tracks put forth distinctly quotidian coping mechanisms for waiting out the \u201cthunder.\u201d", "Throughout the album, Lee carefully avoids any political stance; for Lee, there is no hardship that cannot be overcome with intimacy and affection. On album opener \u201cWritten in Lightning,\u201d he embeds himself into the farmer\u2019s market crowd, asking, \u201cIf love is an armor, then can we love stronger?\u201d On \u201c", ",\u201d Lee romanticizes taking shelter from a storm with a lover by his side: \u201cWhen you hold me, it\u2019s so much better; it\u2019s enough to drown out the thunder.\u201d This doe-eyed optimism is easily digestible, and that is perhaps the biggest issue: the realities Lee purports to write about are not easy.", "Though the lyrical themes may lack potency, ", " highlights Lee\u2019s knack for composing beautiful melodies. It is densely packed with bespoke orchestration, filled with glittering piano and mellow horns. Lee\u2019s voice, as always, is lilting and gentle, so hypnotically rhythmic that it often recalls children\u2019s lullabies. On \u201cNo Dominion,\u201d he strikes an agreeable balance of muted, contemplative piano and somber, religious lyrics: the title is a reference to a poem by Dylan Thomas, which in turn references St. Paul\u2019s epistle to the Romans. The sentiment is heavy, arguing for the perseverance of an ineffable soul after our earthly bodies no longer occupy this earth. For a brief moment, as he sings about reciting Thomas\u2019s morbid poem, his voice drops and flattens. It is a welcome reflection of the sobering topics at hand, and proof that Lee can write an affecting and serious ballad.", "But too often, the preciousness of the album\u2019s instrumentation seems cloying in the face of such weighty subjects. Meditations on historical ignorance like \u201cNew History\u201d are mismatched with the cheery vocal harmonies that deliver them. A solemn commentary on rising sea levels, \u201cWaves Breaking,\u201d is sadly drowned out by the song\u2019s overcrowded arrangement and muddled metaphors. For Lee, romantic and even fantastical idealism has long been a means to parse his inner demons. But when those demons become too large for charming poetics, beatific melodies and jangling orchestral compositions fail to rise to the occasion."]},
