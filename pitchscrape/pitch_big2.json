But any notion that hearing one Roc Marciano album is like hearing them all is put to rest with ", ". Nearly 20 years into his career, with his lane more crowded than ever, Marci has made his raps sharper, let his flows whisk through richer samples, and deepened his commitment to the character he plays. \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect but I\u2019m close/I can\u2019t be cloned, when I was made: after, they broke the mold/It was written in stone,\u201d he raps on a song called \u201cFabio.\u201d", "The same steeliness that powered previous records still powers ", ", but there is a new momentum that props it up as something to behold. Marci has spent much of the \u201910s fine-tuning his twisting technique and blurring the lines between throwback pimp iconography and gritty mafioso rap. But now that his legacy is preserved, he\u2019s stepped out of the shadows a bit. Things are less grainy. Marciano (again) produces the majority of the beats here himself, but he laces some of his crispest sample work without losing that stained, cinematic quality, as if he\u2019s restoring an old spool of film to digital. Beats from ", ", ", ", Animoss, and more are slotted in to add just a touch of color. The choicest among them is the Q-Tip-produced closer \u201cConsigliere,\u201d with its sweeping strings and dusty drums, and Marci lets it wash over him as he raps, \u201cYou know the forte: Ralph Lauren drawers on but fuck the horseplay/Got sauce for days; you got poor taste.\u201d", "The beats are foreboding and gorgeous all at once, but it\u2019s the ways Roc Marciano frames himself inside them that makes ", " so interesting, how his singular syntax reveals his mind. His Aussie bitch is double jointed and the double barrel joint is pointed at your boyfriend (\u201cSampson & Delilah\u201d). He\u2019s Huey Newton in the king\u2019s wicker chair with the pistol near and his face is chiseled in the silverware, with care (\u201cAmethyst\u201d).

Marci\u2019s less animated than ", " but more quotable. He is so blas\u00e9 reenacting the fanciful excursions in his songs that it makes them feel realer and more thrilling.", "The only time Roc Marciano pulls the listener out of his world is when he is reiterating his long-held homophobic worldview.

It follows that a \u201990s rap purist would hold such a retrograde belief; there is no place for it, in our world or his, and it sullies the experience of the album. For a rapper obsessed with relishing his own good taste and beguiling listeners into his densely packed domain, it\u2019s not just inelegant or distasteful, it\u2019s uninviting and obtuse.", "These moments are frequent enough to draw the eye to the seams of Roc Marciano\u2019s illusion on ", " in what is an otherwise mesmerizing character study. His greatest trick is drawing you in so close that you lose the plot. He fits so much scenery, so much detail, into his frame of vision that anything outside the scope is extraneous.

I can distinctly remember that moment I heard Maxwell\u2019s exquisite, subdued soul for the first time as if it beamed in from another time and place; I was lifted right off the Harlem pavement, ascending into the blue and beyond.", "More than two decades after its April 1996 release, ", "\u2014one of that decade\u2019s constitutive R&B albums alongside ", "\u2019s 1993 ", ", ", "\u2019s 1995 ", ", and ", "\u2019s 1997 ", "\u2014remains a decidedly urbane New York City record. Born Gerald Maxwell Rivera and mostly raised by his mother in Brooklyn\u2019s gritty East New York neighborhood, Maxwell started out crafting demos on a janky Casio keyboard when he was 17. Over the next few years, he bopped in and out of NYC recording studios, formulating his sound. Maxwell cut his live chops and developed a solid reputation, crooning at nightclub venues like Nell\u2019s in downtown Manhattan. With melodious hooks to spare, ", " captures the sparkling intimacy and free-flowing conviviality that characterized New York\u2019s R&B open mic nights in the 1990s to a greater degree than almost any other album of its time.", "Maxwell looked like a model. He sported a outtasight, blow-out afro and retro-bohemian fashion that evoked the Afrocentric Fort Greene coffee bars, elegant brownstones, and sandalwood-smoky poetry lounges of mid-\u201990s Brooklyn. While gigging, writing, and recording songs, he picked up spare change pulling shifts as a waiter at Manhattan\u2019s Coffee Shop, a popular and chic Brazilian-themed joint in Union Square. It was there Maxwell met guitarist Hod David, who would go on to co-write \u201cDancewitme\u201d and play on a number of other ", " tracks. Driven by talent and hustle, Maxwell landed a record deal with Columbia Records when he was 21; he remains a quintessentially New York musician.", "Though it illuminates the sound of mid-\u201990s New York R&B lounges, ", " is an even more ambitious project\u2014an 11-song concept album that\u2019s a carnal and spiritual exploration of the mystifying terrain of heterosexual romance. It traces the entire arc of a relationship over the course of 58 minutes, from meeting to macking to break-up to reunion to marriage proposal to consummation. All this relationship drama between a single man and a single woman supposedly takes place in an unusually compressed period of time. For an album that sounds so decompressed, so languorous and so tempo-deliberate (the BPMs never exceed 100), ", " may be, at an even more meta-level, a profound commentary on the politics of place, space and time.", "The story arc gets going with the seductive foreplay of \u201cWelcome\u201d, depicting a chance encounter between Maxwell and a woman, followed by the finger-snappin\u2019 come-on \u201cSumthin\u2019 Sumthin\u2019\u201d and the spiritually blissed-out \u201cAscension (Don\u2019t Ever Wonder).\u201d Heat rises as the duo moves to the bedroom: there\u2019s hard-driving funk jam \u201cDancewitme\u201d and torrid sex storm \u201c\u2026Til the Cops Come Knockin\u2019.\u201d The guitar-led ballad \u201cWhenever Wherever Whatever\u201d\u2014sounding like David Gates of ", ", ", ", and Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim got together and had a baby\u2014suggests a dramatic mood shift.", "Disconsolate and sullen break-up joint \u201cLonely\u2019s the Only Company (I&II)\u201d comes up next.

Because of its relatively restricted budget, Maxwell and crew painstakingly pre-produced, pre-planned, and mapped out large parts of the album at Maxwell\u2019s home set-up and at other NYC recording venues before professionally tracking the material in pricier venues.

Given that self-contained polymaths in R&B and hip-hop\u2014including ", ", ", ", ", ", D\u2019Angelo, and the Tony Rich Project\u2014were increasingly becoming the norm in late 1996, Maxwell\u2019s Columbia A&R rep Mitchell Cohen granted him a relatively large amount of creative freedom. In turn, Maxwell emerged, even from the onset of his career, as an auteur, seemingly in total control of the direction of his sound and style.", "The long-stroke idealization of sex as intimate connection ran counter to romance-challenged, freaky-sex tunes storming the charts around the same time, like R. Kelly\u2019s 1995 \u201cYou Remind Me of Something\u201d and Adina Howard\u2019s \u201cFreak Like Me.\u201d While far too many hip-hop and R&B artists were busy relegating women to the status of video honeys, Maxwell promoted his debut album praising the opposite sex and, according to at least one journalist, telling interviewers he believed God was a woman. What\u2019s more, Maxwell\u2019s cosmological orientation was squarely rooted in R&B, not in hip-hop, which distinguished him from more ruffneck peers like D\u2019Angelo, ", ", and Mark Morrison. Maxwell was selling a bohemian throwback version of gentleman soul at a moment marked by intense commercial pressure for black male R&B artists to keep it real and pledge allegiance to the street.", "While D\u2019Angelo constructed 1995\u2019s ", " out of low-end sonics and throwback jazz, Maxwell had admiration for the Black British artists of the \u201980s and early \u201990s like Sade and Omar, given that they seemed to exert more artistic control than their American counterparts. In pursuit of Sade\u2019s autonomy as well as her atmospheric jazz-inflected sound, he recruited her collaborator Stuart Matthewman as co-writer and co-producer, as well as other members of Sade\u2019s Sweetback band to play on the album. Mixer Mike Pela, who\u2019d also worked with Sade, helped deliver the album\u2019s spacious mix. More than any other artist of his generation, Maxwell made an explicit connection to Sade\u2019s legacy in the crafting of his musical identity (it would be years before ", " and others did the same).", "Maxwell himself was a product of a certain version of transatlantic blackness: he was born to a Haitian mother and a Puerto Rican father who died in a plane crash when he was three. In 1998, Maxwell, seemingly positioning himself as a hybrid of ", " and Bryan Ferry, referred to his own mellow smooth sound as \u201cCaribbean Ambient Soul.\u201d On ", ", Maxwell\u2019s island roots might show up in the album\u2019s sinewy bass grooves, the long instrumental rhythmic stretches, and the vaguely Latin/calypso horn arrangements. But his Caribbean roots have everything to do with his desire to overcome sandbox limitations: \u201cAs a West Indian, Puerto-Rican,\u201d he said in an interview at the time, \u201cI know that a lot of people in my clique are tired of being represented by one or two types of music\u2026There's more to the urban lifestyle than that.\u201d", "The album title alone is a deft double entendre: On one hand, it evokes \u201csuite\u201d as in a collection of songs, and on the other, it invents \u201chang suite\u201d as a hip euphemism for the celebrity hotel suite / metropolitan black bachelor pad. Film scholar Steve Cohan, writing about cinematic representations of the bachelor pad in 1950s pop culture, argues that the post-war bachelor represented a kind of \u201carrested development\u201d in his inability to settle down, even as he captured an exciting new breed of masculine sophistication and sexual intrigue, a playboy alternative to compulsory married life.
